## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently trying to unblock YouTube at my school. I've already had an account on here for a while, you can find it at @javaspence. Unfortunately there is now a heavy ban on phones at my school, therefore I cannot authenticate myself into that account. So this will be used as a school burner.
